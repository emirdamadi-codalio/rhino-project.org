# Docker & Docker Compose

Docker compose configuration is to load all the dependencies for the rhino project template. This includes the database, redis, backend and frontend servers. The source code is mounted as a volume in the containers, so any changes you make to the code will be reflected in the running containers.

## Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you have never used Docker before, please make sure to [read the docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). It will help you understand how it works.

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhino-project/rhino-project-template.git`
```

## Launch the docker containers

```bash
docker compose up
```

That will start all dependencies and the backend and frontend servers. The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend server at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Running commands in the containers

Launch a bash shell in the backend container:

```bash
 docker compose exec backend bash
```

or in the frontend container:

```bash
 docker compose exec frontend bash
```

### Running one-off commands in the containers

You can run one-off commands in the container without launching a shell. For example, to run a rails command in the backend container:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend [your_rails_or_rhino_command_here]
```

That will run the command by spawning a new `backend` container and removing it once the command returns. Make sure you use the `--rm` flag, otherwise you'll end up with a lot of stopped containers over time.

For example, to run a rails console, use `docker compose run --rm backend rails console`. To run a migration, use `docker compose run --rm backend rails db:migrate`.

:::tip
It may be a smart idea to creata an alias shortcut for `docker-compose run --rm backend` for better productivity.

## Stopping dependencies

```bash
docker compose down
```

That will stop and remove all running containers.

## Running dependencies separately

It is possible to run detached docker containers. This is particularly useful when the dependencies are unchanged but the rhino server configuration is updated. This way, you don't need to kill all dependencies to reboot the server.
It is also useful when you just want to run the server but don't see the logs in your terminal.
To do so, you need to run `docker compose up` with the names of the container dependencies as arguments, and the `-d` flag.

```bash
docker compose run -d db redis
```

This will run db and redis separately in the background. If you now run `docker compose up`, it will use the background containers for `db` and `redis` and only start the `backend` container in the foreground.

## Troubleshooting

Docker compose configuration is provided for: `postgres`, `redis`, `backend` and `frontend`. All have beend configured with named volumes. Docker containers don't persist data, any data is deleted when the container is removed. The volumes make sure we don't lose any data and speed up starting the containers.

With docker compose, the volume names follow a convention: `parent_folder_name_in_lower_case` followed by `the_volume_name_in_the_docker_compose_file`. For `rhino-project_template`, the volume will be

- `rhino_project_template_db_data` postgres data
- `rhino_project_template_redis_data` redis data
- `rhino_project_template_gem_cache` bundler cache
- `rhino_project_template_npm_cache` node modules cache
- `rhino_project_template_shared_data` other shared data

Where possible the containers are isolated to a specific network to prevent conflicts with other services running on the host machine, `rhino-project-template_development`.

### I cannot connect to the database or redis

Make sure the database and redis containers are running.

```bash
docker container ls
```

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
5ac2b9717382   postgres:12.5-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   58 seconds ago   Up 54 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   db
414d22548a08   redis:6.2-alpine       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   58 seconds ago   Up 55 seconds   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp   redis
```

If you don't see any of them on that list, use `docker compose up -d redis db` to start them in the background.

### Database permission / migration issues

It is possible that your docker database is in an inconsistent state due to the change of environment variables or branch work.

1. Make sure you stop all containers
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
2. List the available volumes
   ```bash
   docker volume ls | grep db_data
   ```
   It should return this:
   ```bash
   local     rhino_project_template_db_data
   ```
3. Delete the volume
   ```bash
   docker volume rm rhino_project_template_db_data
   ```
4. Start the database container again. It will automatically create a new volume.
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db
   ```
   It should return something like this:
   ```bash
   [+] Running 3/3
   ✔ Network rhino_project_template_development  Created                0.1s
   ✔ Volume "rhino_project_template_db_data"     Created                0.0s
   ✔ Container db                            Started                0.7s
   ```
5. Setup the rhino database
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm backend rails db:setup
   ```
