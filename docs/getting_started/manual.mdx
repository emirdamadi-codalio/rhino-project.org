## Updating the production model data

Data model can be updated for production with:

```
rails rhino:open_api_export
```

## Developing the front end against remote server

Because of CORS by default you will not be able to work against a deployed production server. However if you set `FRONT_END_LOCAL_URL=http://localhost:3001` you can.

## Customization

The data model driving the UI is loaded from src/models/index.js in production or or dynamically from the server at /api/info/openapi in development (by default http://localhost:3000/api/info/openapi). See [Updating the production models](#updating-the-production-model-data) for
further instructions on export.
