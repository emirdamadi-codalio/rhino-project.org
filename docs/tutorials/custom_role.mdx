# Creating a custom role

This tutorial will walk you through adding a custom author role to your application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have completed the [Organization and Roles Tutorial](./organization)

## Data model

The data model for this tutorial is the same as the [Organization and Roles Tutorial](./organization)

## Generate a new policy

From the `server` directory run the following command:

```bash
rails generate rhino:policy Author
```

:::info
`rails generate` is a built in Rails command that will run a generator for you. In this case we are generating a new policy called "author". There are a number of generators available in Rails & Rhino. You can see a list of them by running `rails generate` without any arguments.
:::

There will now be a new files, `app/policies/author_policy.rb` with the skeleton of a policy and `test/policies/author_policy_test.rb` with the skeleton of a policy test.

## Edit the policy

```ruby title="app/policies/author_policy.rb"
class AuthorPolicy < ::Rhino::ViewerPolicy
  def check_author
    return false unless auth_owner

    # Check if the user is the author of the blog
    record.class.where(id: record.id).joins(record.joins_for(:blog)).exists?("blogs.user_id": auth_owner.id)
  end

  # Can always create (for themselves)
  def create?
    authorize_action(true)
  end

  # Can only update if they are the author
  def update?
    authorize_action(check_author)
  end

  # Can only destroy if they are the author
  def destroy?
    authorize_action(check_author)
  end

  class Scope < ::Rhino::ViewerPolicy::Scope
  end
end
```

## Seed the database

Create an additional organization and role for testing.

```diff title="db/seeds.rb"
# Generate sample categories
3.times do
  Category.create!(name: FFaker::Book.unique.genre)
end

# Function to generate sample blogs and blog posts
def generate_blogs(user, org)
  5.times do
    blog = Blog.create!(user_id: user.id, organization: org, title: FFaker::Book.unique.author, category_id: Category.ids.sample)
    20.times do
      BlogPost.create!(blog_id: blog.id, title: FFaker::Book.unique.title, body: FFaker::Book.unique.description, published: [true, false].sample)
    end
  end
end

# Create two sample users
user = User.create!(email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password')
user_other = User.create!(email: 'other@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password')

# Create sample organizations
# highlight-next-line
-org = ["Single User Org", "Multi User Org", "Viewer Org", "Editor Org"].map do |name|
# highlight-next-line
+org = ["Single User Org", "Multi User Org", "Viewer Org", "Editor Org", "Author Org"].map do |name|
  Organization.create!(name:)
end

role_admin = Role.create!(name: "admin")
role_viewer = Role.create!(name: "viewer")
role_editor = Role.create!(name: "editor")
# highlight-next-line
+role_author = Role.create!(name: "author")

# The test@example.com user is the only user and admin of the "Single User Org" organization
UsersRole.create!(user: user, organization: org[0], role: role_admin)
# Only test@example.com authors blogs in the "MuSinglelti User Org" organization
generate_blogs(user, org[0])

# The test@example.com and other@example.com are both users and admins of the "Multi User Org" organization
UsersRole.create!(user: user, organization: org[1], role: role_admin)
# Both users author blogs in the "Multi User Org" organization
generate_blogs(user, org[1])
generate_blogs(user_other, org[1])

# The test@example.com is a viewer and other@example.com is an admin of the "Viewer Org" organization
UsersRole.create!(user: user, organization: org[2], role: role_viewer)
UsersRole.create!(user: user_other, organization: org[2], role: role_admin)
# Only other@example.com authors blogs in the "Viewer Org" organization
generate_blogs(user_other, org[3])

# The test@example.com is an editor and other@example.com is an admin of the "Editor Org" organization
UsersRole.create!(user: user, organization: org[3], role: role_editor)
UsersRole.create!(user: user_other, organization: org[3], role: role_admin)
# Only other@example.com authors blogs in the "Editor Org" organization
generate_blogs(user_other, org[3])

# highlight-next-line
+# The test@example.com is an author and other@example.com is an admin of the "Author Org" organization
# highlight-next-line
+UsersRole.create!(user: user, organization: org[4], role: role_author)
# highlight-next-line
+UsersRole.create!(user: user_other, organization: org[4], role: role_admin)
# highlight-next-line
+# Only other@example.com authors blogs in the "Editor Org" organization
# highlight-next-line
+generate_blogs(user, org[4])
# highlight-next-line
+generate_blogs(user_other, org[4])
```

And add the seed data to the database

```bash
rails db:seed
```

## Restart the server

```bash
rails s
```

## Try the Author Org

Login to the application with `test@example.com` and `password` and switch to the "Author Org" organization. Viewing the blogs where the author is `test@example.com` will allow editing and deleting:

![](/img/tutorial_custom_role_author.png)

While blogs where the author is not `test@example.com` will not:
