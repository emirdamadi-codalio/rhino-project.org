# Modules

Modules in Rhino provide and extend the functionality of the core application. They are intended to be used for functionality that is not required by all users of Rhino, but is required by some. [Organizations](../../tutorials/organization.mdx), [Jobs](../../guides/jobs.mdx), [Notifications](../../guides/notifications.mdx), [Subscriptions](../../guides/subscription.mdx) are all examples of modules.

Modules are created as "full" Rails plugins and backed by [Engines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) in Rails and are installed initially via [Generators](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html).

### Creating

A new module can be created with

```bash
rails rhino:module:new
```

and a mountable module with

```bash
rails rhino:module:new --mountable
```

:::tip
Module names should describe the functionality provided rather than the technology used, for instance 'rhino_subscriptions' instead of 'rhino_stripe'.
:::

### Installation

Each module provides an installation command for instance

```bash
rails rhino_jobs:install
```

that installs migrations (if any) and allows you to do any other setup work in `install_generator.rb`.

### Registration

Modules should register themselves and metadata as appropriate in `engine.rb`:

```ruby
initializer 'rhino_organizations.register_module' do
  config.after_initialize do
    Rhino.registered_modules[:rhino_organizations] = {
      version: RhinoOrganizations::VERSION
      allow_signup: true
    }
  end
end
```

### Testing

After creating the module, tests are runnable with

```bash
rails rhino:module:test MODULE_NAME
```

and can be added to the CircleCI job to generate coverage

```bash
rails rhino:module:coverage MODULE_NAME
```

Full modules have a dummy app for testing. This can be setup and used as follows

```bash
rails rhino:module:dummy MODULE_NAME db:setup
rails rhino:module:dummy MODULE_NAME server
```
