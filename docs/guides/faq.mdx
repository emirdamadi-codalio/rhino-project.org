## How deep are breadcrumbs?

Breadcrumbs are limited to the number of levels of nesting along the ownership chain in the model `rhino_reference` on the server side. For example, if there is a `Comment` model with

```ruby
rhino_reference [post: :blog]
```

then 2 levels of nesting will be present in the breadcrumbs when viewing a comment in the client.
