# IDEs

## VSCode

Rhino will recommend extensions for both the server and client when loading the workspace. You can also install the recommended extensions manually. Format on save is recommended for the client (prettier) and server (rubocop via the [Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp) plugin from Shopify).

## RubyMine

RubyMine is a good alternative, particularly if you are new to Ruby and Rails. It has a lot of features that help you learn the language and framework. It is also a good IDE for debugging.

## Multiple projects

If you are working on multiple projects that use rhino, you can configure different ports with `rails rhino:dev:setup`.
