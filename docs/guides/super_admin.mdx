# Super Admin

By default Rhino includes an admin dashboard that allows you to manage your application. This dashboard is built using the [ActiveAdmin](https://activeadmin.info/) gem and themed with [arctic_admin](https://github.com/cprodhomme/arctic_admin) and installs [activeadmin_addons](https://github.com/platanus/activeadmin_addons) gem to add some extra functionality.

The dashboard is accessible at `/admin` and requires an admin user to log in.

## Configuration

The admin dashboard configuration is in `config/initializers/active_admin.rb` and can be altered to the project needs.

## Generating an admin resource

To generate an admin resource with Rhino defaults, use the following command:

```bash
rails g rhino:resource ModelName
```

:::info
This generator is included by default if you run `rails g rhino:model`.
:::

This will generate a model in the `app/admin` folder with the default Rhino configuration for the model, like so:

```ruby
ActiveAdmin.register ModelName do
  rhino_filters
  rhino_permit_params
end
```

That provides the default filters and permit params for the model and `index` and other configuration options can be added as needed.

### Generating an admin resource with ActiveAdmin defaults

If more control is needed over the resource, generate or replace an ActiveAdmin resource with the following command:

```bash
rails g admin:resource ModelName
```

## Security

ActiveAdmin 3+ requires ransack 4 which has a system for [whitelisting attributes and scopes](https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/going-further/other-notes/#authorization-allowlistingdenylisting) for searching. Rhino by default allows the same attributes and associations for viewing and for filtering as for reading.

To customize the attributes and associations that can be searched, you can override the `ransackable_attributes`, `ransackable_associations`, and `ransackable_filters` methods in your model.

```ruby
    def ransackable_attributes(_auth_object = nil)
      super + ['my_special_attribute']
    end

    def ransackable_associations(_auth_object = nil)
      super + ['my_special_scope']
    end

    def ransackable_filters(auth_object = nil)
      super + ['my_special_filter']
    end
  end
```

### Optimizing select filters

ActiveAdmin’s default select filter loads all records from the database which can cause significant performance issues. To avoid this, a lazy typeahead select filter can be created using [activeadmin_addons](https://github.com/platanus/activeadmin_addons), and the [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack) gem used by ActiveAdmin.

Imagine we have an InvoiceLineItem table, that belongs to a UsersRole, that in turn belongs to a User. If we want a “User“ filter in the InvoiceLineItem Index page, we would do something like this:

```ruby title="app/admin/invoice_line_items.rb"
ActiveAdmin.register InvoiceLineItem do
  preserve_default_filters!
  remove_filter :users_role # remove original filter
  filter :users_role_user_id, # this name must contain the relationships path from the model from the index page until the user table, so invoice_line_item -> users_role -> user. the engine will do a join.
    label: "User",
    as: :search_select_filter,
    url: proc { admin_users_path }, # AJAX endpoint
    fields: %w[name nickname email], # columns in the looked up table to be compared against
    minimum_input_length: 2,
    method_model: User, # original table
    width: "190px", # necessary for fixing a UI bug
    display_name: "full_nickname_and_email", # custom display name that gives you more flexibility to use whatever you want
    order_by: "name"
end
```

Create a json view for the admin_users_path to return a custom attribute that will be shown in the results select box.

```ruby title="app/views/admin/users/index.json.jbuilder"
json.array!(@users) do |user|
  json.extract! user, :id, :full_nickname_and_email
end
```

Finish up by implementing the custom display field in the User model:

```ruby title="app/models/user.rb"
def full_nickname_and_email
  "#{nickname || name} - #{email}"
end
```

:::info
jbuilder is no longer included in Rhino by default. You will need to add it to your Gemfile.
