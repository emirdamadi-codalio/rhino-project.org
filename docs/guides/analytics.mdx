# Analytics

Analtyics are a powerful tool to understand how your application is being used. Rhino provides a simple way to integrate analytics into your application using

There are many available services that provide analytics. [Segment](https://segment.com/) is the chosen one by default as it can connect multiple sources of analytics data to multiple destinations (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Intercom, etc).

## Events

Rhino as best as possible follows the [Segment B2B Saas Spec](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/b2b-saas/) for both the front end and the back end.

### Back End User Events

The following events are sent to Segment from the back end:

- Account Created
- Account Deleted
- Signed Up
- Signed In
- Signed Out
- Invite Sent
- Account Added User
- Account Removed User

Custom events can be added by calling `Rhino::SegmentHelper.track`

### Front End User Events

Page and identify events are sent to Segment from the front end automatically via the `<PageAnalytics>` component.
