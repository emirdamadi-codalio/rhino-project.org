# Background Jobs

[ActiveJob](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) backed by [Solid Queue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue) is the basis for background and scheduled jobs in Rhino Jobs.

By default Rhino configures Solid Queue to run in [single database form](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue?tab=readme-ov-file#single-database-configuration) for ease of deployment, but does not use Solid Queue in development or test environments by default.

The queues can be configured in `config/queue.yml` and recurring tasks in `config/recurring.yml`.

## Creating a job

Create a job with standard rails generator:

```bash
rails g job Test
```

## Running a job

```ruby
TestJob.perform_later
```

## Processing the queue

Setting the environment variable `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA` or running `bin/jobs` will have the puma web server process the queue, including scheduled jobs.

## Monitoring jobs

Rhino installs and configures [Mission Control Jobs](https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs) to monitor jobs. The dashboard is available at `/jobs` with an admin user.

### Scaling

The first step in scaling is to run the workers outside of the web server with `bin/jobs`. The Heroku `Procfile` and `heroku.yml` is already configured to run `bin/jobs`. Simply enable the

:::tip
Make sure to remove the SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA environment variable from the web server if you run `bin/jobs` in a separate process.

Next is to run multiple workers. This can be done by running `bin/jobs` on multiple servers.

If performance continues to be a bottleneck, the move the Solid Queue database to a separate database - revert the`QueueSchema` migration and reinstall the Solid Queue database with `bin/rails solid_queue:install` - see https://github.com/rails/solid_queue?tab=readme-ov-file#installation for more information.
