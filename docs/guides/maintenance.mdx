# Core Maintenance

## Security

The core rhino repo `rhino-project/rhino-project-template` is configured to use Dependabot for security to automatically flag issues. Dependabot will open a PR when a dependency has a new version available.

### Frontend

In the `client` sub directory, if the package is not a top level package in `package.json`, then find top level package and update that version. Use `npm ls` to find the top level package.

```bash
npm ls <lower-level-package>
```

### Backend

In the `server` sub directory, if the gem is not a top level gem in `Gemfile`, then find top level gem and update the version there. Use `bundle list` to find the top level gem.

```bash
gem dependency <lower-level-gem> --reverse-dependencies
```

If the gem is typically installed by Rails (for instance `puma`) test to see if the "soft" dependency specified in `Gemfile.lock` is compatible with the new version. If it is, then update the version in `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.

You can check this by running:

```bash
rails new testapp-<latest-version>
```

and checking the `Gemfile.lock` in the new app.
