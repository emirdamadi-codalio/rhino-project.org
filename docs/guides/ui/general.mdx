# General Configuration

General configuration options for the Rhino UI as well as global overrides for the Rhino UI components can be configured in the `rhino.config.js` file.

## Root configuration

### `appName`

A string that is used as the name of the application. This is used in the title of the pages and in the authentication pages.

### `enableModelRoutes`

A boolean that determines whether the model routes are enabled. If this is set to `false`, the default model routes will not be registered.

## Component configuration

See other guides in the [UI Customization](../ui_customization) section for component specific configuration options.
