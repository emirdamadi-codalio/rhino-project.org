# General Configuration

## Theming

Dark mode is supported and can be enabled by setting the `dark` class on the `html` element in the `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` file. The Rhino UI components will automatically adjust their appearance based on the presence of this class.

## rhino.config.js

General configuration options for much of the Rhino UI as well as global overrides for the Rhino UI components can be configured in the `rhino.config.js` file.

### Root configuration

#### `appName`

A string that is used as the name of the application. This is used in the title of the pages and in the authentication pages.

#### `enableModelRoutes`

A boolean that determines whether the model routes are enabled. If this is set to `false`, the default model routes will not be registered.

#### `darkLogo` and `lightLogo`

Paths relative to the `src/assets` directory for the dark and light logos. Defaults to `images/logo-dark.svg` and `images/logo-light.svg` respectively.

### Component configuration

See other guides in the [UI Customization](../ui_customization) section for component specific configuration options.
