# File Storage

File storage capabilities are available in Rhino with the [ActiveStorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html). Rhino provides an authenticated endpoint for redirect mode in ActiveStorage as well as direct upload integration on the frontend.

In development ActiveStorage is used to . Set up a cloud provider storage service to use ActiveStorage in production and then use the standard `has_one_attached` and `has_many_attached` methods to attach files to your models and add the attachment as a permitted reference in your controller.

```ruby
class Blog < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  # highlight-next-line
  has_one_attached :banner

  rhino_owner_base
  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_references [:banner_attachment]
end

```

## S3

To use S3 as your cloud provider, add the `aws-sdk-s3` gem to your Gemfile:

```bash
bundle add aws-sdk-s3
```

Then configure your storage service in with the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_S3_BUCKET` which are used by default in `config/storage.yml`:

```yaml title="config/storage.yml"
service: S3
access_key_id: <%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
secret_access_key: <%= ENV['AWS_SECRET_KEY'] %>
region: <%= ENV['AWS_REGION'] %>
bucket: <%= ENV['AWS_S3_BUCKET'] %>
```

:::warning
You must set up CORS for the bucket you are using to allow uploads from your domain. See [this sample](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#example-s3-cors-configuration) for more information.
