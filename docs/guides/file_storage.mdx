# File Storage

File storage capabilities are available in Rhino with the [ActiveStorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html). Rhino provides an authenticated endpoint for redirect mode in ActiveStorage as well as direct upload integration on the frontend.

In development ActiveStorage is used to . Set up a cloud provider storage service to use ActiveStorage in production and then use the standard `has_one_attached` and `has_many_attached` methods to attach files to your models and add the attachment as a permitted reference in your controller.

```ruby
class Blog < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  # highlight-next-line
  has_one_attached :banner

  rhino_owner_base
  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_references [:banner_attachment]
end
```

or for multiple attachments:

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog

  # highlight-next-line
  has_many_attached :images

  rhino_owner :blog

  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_references [:images_attachments]
end
```

## Variants, Previews, and Representations

ActiveStorage provides a number of ways to manipulate and display images and other files. Variants are used to resize images and previews are used to generate thumbnails. Representations are used to generate different formats of the file.

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog

  # highlight-next-line
  has_many_attached :images do |attachable|
    attachable.variant :thumb, resize_and_pad: [ 100, 100 ], preprocessed: true
  end

  rhino_owner :blog
  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_references [:images_attachments]
end
```

:::tip
The `preprocessed: true` option is used to generate the variant when the file is uploaded. This is useful for generating thumbnails and other variants when the file is uploaded in the background.
:::

The Rhino API returns the URL for the variant, preview, or representation in the API response. The URL can be used to display the image or preview in the frontend.

## S3

To use S3 as your cloud provider, add the `aws-sdk-s3` gem to your Gemfile:

```bash
bundle add aws-sdk-s3
```

Then configure your storage service in with the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_S3_BUCKET` which are used by default in `config/storage.yml`:

```yaml title="config/storage.yml"
service: S3
access_key_id: <%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
secret_access_key: <%= ENV['AWS_SECRET_KEY'] %>
region: <%= ENV['AWS_REGION'] %>
bucket: <%= ENV['AWS_S3_BUCKET'] %>
```

And finally, change the active storage service from `:local` to `:amazon` in `config/environments/production.rb` file:

```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :amazon
```

:::warning
You must set up CORS for the bucket you are using to allow uploads from your domain. See [this sample](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#example-s3-cors-configuration) for more information.

## Google Cloud Storage

To use Google Cloud Storage as your cloud provider, add the `google-cloud-storage` gem to your Gemfile:

```bash
bundle add google-cloud-storage
```

Then configure your storage service in with the environment variables `GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_TYPE`, `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID`, `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_BUCKET` which are used by default in `config/storage.yml`:

```yaml title="config/storage.yml"
google:
  service: GCS
  credentials:
    type: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_TYPE') %>
    project_id: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID') %>
    private_key_id: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID') %>
    private_key: |
      <%=  ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY').lines.map.with_index { |l, i| i == 0 ? l : "      #{l}" }.join %>
    client_email: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL') %>
    client_id: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID') %>
  project: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID') %>
  bucket: <%= ENV.fetch('GOOGLE_BUCKET') %>
```

And finally, change the active storage service from `:local` to `:google` in `config/environments/production.rb` file:

```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :google
```

:::warning
You must set up CORS for the bucket you are using to allow uploads from your domain. See [this sample](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#example-google-cloud-storage-cors-configuration) for more information.
