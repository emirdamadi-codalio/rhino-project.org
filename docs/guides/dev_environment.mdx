# Dev Environment

Ensure that you have completed the [prerequisites](../tutorials/index.mdx#prerequisites) before continuing. Then from the root of the boilerplate_server repo run the following commands:

```bash
rails rhino:dev:setup
```

This will set up the .env files and install git hooks.

## Docker (optional but recommended)

Before starting, please make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. If you have never used Docker before, please make sure to [read the docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). It will help you understand how it works.

TLDR: A dependency becomes an image, and images are run on isolated containers. Instead of downloading and installing dependencies manually, you download the docker images and run them in docker containers.

Answer `y` when prompted by `rails rhino:dev:setup` with: `Run server on docker?`. This will setup some default environment variable values for Docker support.

We provide 3 docker images: `postgres`, `redis` and the rhino server itself.
`postgres` and `redis` have been configured with named volumes. Docker containers don't persist data, any data is deleted when the container is removed. The volumes make sure we don't lose any data.

With docker compose, the volume names follow a convention: `parent_folder_name_in_lower_case` followed by `the_volume_name_in_the_docker_compose_file`. For `boilerplate_server`, the volume names will be `boilerplate_server_db_data` and `boilerplate_server_redis_data`.

### Downloading and building images

In the repo's root folder, run `docker compose pull` to download all prebuilt images. This will download the images for `postgres` and `redis`. Use `docker compose build` to build the image for the rhino rails server.

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose build
```

### Running dependencies

```bash
docker compose up
```

That will start all dependencies and the main server.

### Running rails / rhino commands in docker

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend [your_rails_or_rhino_command_here]
```

That will run the command by spawning a new `backend` container and removing it once the command returns. Make sure you use the `--rm` flag, otherwise you'll end up with a lot of stopped containers over time.

For example, to run a rails console, use `docker compose run --rm backend rails console`. To run a migration, use `docker compose run --rm backend rails db:migrate`.

PS.: it may be a smart idea to creata an alias shortcut for `docker-compose run --rm backend` for better productivity.

### Stopping dependencies

```bash
docker compose down
```

That will stop and remove all running containers.

### Running dependencies separately

It is possible to run detached docker containers. This is particularly useful when the dependencies are unchanged but the rhino server configuration is updated. This way, you don't need to kill all dependencies to reboot the server.
It is also useful when you just want to run the server but don't see the logs in your terminal.
To do so, you need to run `docker compose up` with the names of the container dependencies as arguments, and the `-d` flag.

```bash
docker compose run -d db redis
```

This will run db and redis separately in the background. If you now run `docker compose up`, it will use the background containers for `db` and `redis` and only start the `backend` container in the foreground.

### Troubleshooting

#### I cannot connect to the database or redis

Make sure the database and redis containers are running.

```bash
docker container ls
```

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
5ac2b9717382   postgres:12.5-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   58 seconds ago   Up 54 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   db
414d22548a08   redis:6.2-alpine       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   58 seconds ago   Up 55 seconds   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp   redis
```

If you don't see any of them on that list, use `docker compose up -d redis db` to start them in the background.

#### Database permission / migration issues

It is possible that your docker database is in an inconsistent state due to the change of environment variables or branch work.

1. Make sure you stop all containers
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
2. List the available volumes
   ```bash
   docker volume ls | grep db_data
   ```
   It should return this:
   ```bash
   local     boilerplate_server_db_data
   ```
3. Delete the volume
   ```bash
   docker volume rm boilerplate_server_db_data
   ```
4. Start the database container again. It will automatically create a new volume.
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db
   ```
   It should return something like this:
   ```bash
   [+] Running 3/3
   ✔ Network boilerplate_server_development  Created                0.1s
   ✔ Volume "boilerplate_server_db_data"     Created                0.0s
   ✔ Container db                            Started                0.7s
   ```
5. Setup the rhino database
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm backend rails db:setup
   ```

## IDEs

### VSCode

Rhino will recommend extensions for both the server and client when loading the workspace. You can also install the recommended extensions manually. Format on save is recommended for the client (prettier) and server (rubocop via the [Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp) plugin from Shopify).

### RubyMine

RubyMine is a good alternative, particular if you are new to Ruby and Rails. It has a lot of features that help you learn the language and framework. It is also a good IDE for debugging.

## Multiple projects

If you are working on multiple projects that use the boilerplate_server, you should configure different ports with `rails rhino:dev:setup`.
