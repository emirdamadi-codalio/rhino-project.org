# Routes

Routes for Rhino models listed as resources in `server/config/rhino.rb` are automatically generated. The routes are based on the model name and the owner of the model. The routes are generated for the standard CRUD actions except for globally owned models which only have the index and show actions. The base scope for the API routes is `/api`.

## Adding and Removing specific API routes

Specific API routes for a model can be removed with Rhino configuration directives. The `only` and `except` options can be used to specify which routes to include or exclude.

```ruby
class Blog < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  rhino_owner_base
  rhino_references %i[user]
  # highlight-next-line
  # Only index route will be available
  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_routing only: [:index]
end
```

```ruby
class Blog < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user

  rhino_owner_base
  rhino_references %i[user]
  # highlight-next-line
  # All routes except destroy will be available
  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_routing except: [:destroy]
end
```

## Adding custom API routes

Custom API routes can be added to the Rhino API by adding them to the `server/config/routes.rb` file. The routes can be added in the standard Rails way.

```ruby title="server/config/routes.rb"
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  scope Rhino.namespace do
    # highlight-next-line
    get 'api/mycustom_endpoint', to: 'mycustomcontroller#index'

    devise_for :admin_users, ActiveAdmin::Devise.config
    ActiveAdmin.routes(self)
  end

  root to: redirect(ENV["FRONT_END_URL"] || "/"), via: :all
end
```

## Changing the base API scope

The `namespace` configuration option can be used to change the base scope for the API routes. For example, setting `config.namespace = :my_api` would change the base scope for the API routes to `/my_api`.

```ruby title="server/config/rhino.rb"
Rhino.setup do |config|
  # ==> Owner configuration
  # The auth owner class
  # config.auth_owner = 'User'

  # The base owner class
  # config.base_owner = "Organization"

  # ==> Resource Configuration

  # Include Rhino::Resource::ActiveRecordExtension by default
  # config.auto_include_active_record = true

  # The root path for the api ie '/api'
  # highlight-next-line
  config.namespace = :my_api

  # Authentication
  # config.allow_signup = true

  # The list of resources exposed in the API
  config.resources += ["User"]
end
```
