# Environment Variables

## .env Files

Rhino uses dotenv to load environment variables from `.env` files. The `.env` files are located in the root directory. The `.env` file is not checked into source control.

The rails application uses the [dotenv-rails](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem to load the `.env` file. The `ruby_vite` gem uses the built in [Vite env support](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode) to load the `.env` file.

## Client Environment Variables

The client environment variables are prefixed with `VITE_`. The client environment variables are loaded into the client at build time. useRhinoConfig will load the client environment variables into the client without the prefix.

```jsx
import { useRhinoConfig } from "@rhino-project/config";

const MyWidget = {
const {
  env: { API_ROOT_PATH },
} = useRhinoConfig();

return <div>{API_ROOT_PATH}</div>;
};
```

or you can directly access the the unprefixed environment variables.

```jsx
import env from "@rhino-project/config/env";

const MY_API_ENDPOINT = new URL("my-api", env.API_ROOT_PATH).toString();
```

The environment variables are also available via the `import.meta.env` object from Vite.

### IntelliSense for TypeScript

By default, Rhino provides type definitions for the Rhino environment in `@rhino-project/config/rhino-env`. While you can define more custom env variables in .env files, you may want to get TypeScript IntelliSense for user-defined env variables that are prefixed with VITE\_ and made available in Rhino Config. To achieve this, you can edit `app/frontend/rhino-env.d.ts` , then augment RhinoEnv like this:

```jsx
/// <reference types="@rhino-project/config/rhino-env" />

interface RhinoEnv {
  MY_CUSTOM_ENV: string;
}
```

:::tip
VITE_MY_CUSTOM_ENV can also be added to `app/frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` if you want to use it directly from `import.meta.env`.
:::

:::warning
Imports will break type augmentation

If the RhinoEnv augmentation does not work, make sure you do not have any import statements in rhino-env.d.ts. See the TypeScript documentation for more information.
