# Websockets

Websocket support in Rhino is provided by [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html). By default websockets are authenticated by not authorized (you must ensure the user has access to the data they are requesting).

## Installation

Websockets are supported out of the box as long as Redis is available in your environment. You will need to set the allowed origins in your environment configuration.

```ruby title="config/environments/production.rb"
config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins = ['https://example.com']
```

### Creating a channel

```bash
rails g channel Test
```

## Connecting to a channel

The front end provides a `useCable` hook that can be used to connect to a channel.

```jsx
const consumer = useCable();
const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!resource?.id) return;

  consumer.subscriptions.create(
    { channel: "TestChannel", id: resource.id },
    {
      connected() {},
      received(data) {
        setMessages((currentValues) => {
          const a = [...currentValues, data];

          return a;
        });
      },
    }
  );
}, [consumer, resource.id]);
```
