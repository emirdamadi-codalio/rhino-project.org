# Deployment

This guide is an introduction to deploying Rhino

## General considerations

Rhino uses server side cookies for auth, so you must have [domains that meet the auth rules](/docs/concepts/auth)

## Heroku

For both client and server the default Heroku stack `heroku-22` is recommended.

### Server

The server needs the `https://github.com/lstoll/heroku-buildpack-monorepo` and `heroku/ruby` buildpack. Along with the following add-ons:

    heroku-postgresql:mini
    heroku-redis:mini
    papertrail:choklad
    rollbar:free

Redis is required only for [rhino_jobs](/docs/guides/jobs) support and rollbar is required for [error trapping](error_reporting).

The server requires the following environment variables to be set:

```env
    APP_BASE=server
    FRONT_END_URL=https://<client-host-name>,
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    RACK_ENV=production
    RAILS_ENV=production
    RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=enabled
    RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=enabled
    ROOT_URL=https://<server-host-name>
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=<generated-secret-key>
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=<sendgrid-api-key>
```

### Client

The client needs the `https://github.com/lstoll/heroku-buildpack-monorepo`, `heroku/nodejs` and `heroku-community/nginx` buildpacks

The client requires the following environment variables to be set:

```env
    APP_BASE=client
    VITE_API_ROOT_PATH=https://<server-host-name>
    NODE_ENV=production
```

Any additional environment variables that need to be passed into that app should be prefixed with `VITE_`

## Heroku Docker

Rhino comes with default support for deploying to Heroku with docker for server only. This is useful if you need to deploy custom tools to the image, for instance an SDK that needs to be built and called from ActiveJob.

Rhino does _not_ directly support Heroku for the client because of https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml#set-build-time-environment-variables - build time variables cannot be sourced from environment variables.  The Dockerfile must altered to provide VITE_API_ROOT_PATH directly.

Rhino uses the heroku.yml method of building and deploying docker images. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml

The buildpack for docker should be set to the container type `heroku stack:set container -a <app-name>`

## Docker

### Server

```bash
$ docker build -t server .
$ docker run -it --rm -p 3002:3002 -e FRONT_END_URL="http://localhost:3003" -e PORT=3002 -e DISABLE_SSL=1 -e ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3002 server
```

FRONT_END_URL will default to `http://localhost:3001` if not specified.

PORT will default to `3000` if not specified.

DISABLE_SSL=1 is necessary for SSL termination earlier in the process.

ROOT_URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000` if not specified.

DB_NAME, DB_HOST, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD are also required for the postgres db.

DEFAULT_EMAIL_SENDER defaults to `from@example.com` if not specified.

### Client

```bash
$ docker build --build-arg VITE_API_ROOT_PATH=http://localhost:3002 -t frontend .
$ docker run --rm -p 3003:3003 -e PORT=3003 frontend
```

`VITE_API_ROOT_PATH` is _required_ at build time.

PORT will default to `3001` if not overridden.
