# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Organization

This site aspires to follow the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for documentation. The site is organized into four sections:

- **Tutorials** - A series of step-by-step guides that take the reader through the process of building a complete application.

- **How-to Guides** - A series of articles that provide practical advice on how to solve a specific problem.

- **API (Reference)** - A series of articles that provide detailed information about a specific topic.

- **Concepts (Explanations)** - A series of articles that provide background information on a specific topic.

## Development

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
