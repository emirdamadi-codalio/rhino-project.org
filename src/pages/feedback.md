# Donations

We'll donate $25 USD to on behalf of the first 25 people to give constructive feedback before Dec 1, 2024 in [Discord](https://discord.gg/veHhx2Pr)!

## Background

We started this as an internal project several years ago and over time evolved it into more of a framework approach. While we have a lot more in mind, we wanted to get some feedback.
